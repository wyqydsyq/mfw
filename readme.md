=====

mfw is a lightweight and flexible MVC PHP framework. It's not meant to single-handedly solve every problem, and it's not meant to impose restrictions or cramp your coding style.

It's here to help you get your job done, however you do that is up to you. mfw is a tool, not a way of life.

Requirements
-----
* PHP 5+
* Apache 2.2+
